A curated collection of production-ready Claude Skills for building effective AI applications.

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive resource for developers working with Claude. It provides reusable Skills that teach Claude how to work according to your standards, along with agent workflow patterns, specification templates, and best practices for building production-ready AI systems.

## Repository Structure

### Skills
Reusable capabilities that teach Claude how to work according to your standards and procedures.

- **spec-templates/** - Skills for generating and working with specifications
- **agents/** - Skills for orchestrating agent behaviors
- **prompt-engineering/** - Advanced prompting techniques and patterns
- **examples/** - Community-contributed and reference Skills

### Agents
Practical implementations of agent patterns and workflows.

- **workflows/** - Predefined workflow patterns (prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, etc.)
- **autonomous/** - Autonomous agent implementations with dynamic decision-making

### Templates
Spec-driven development templates for consistent project documentation.

- **project-specs/** - Product requirement documents and project specifications
- **api-specs/** - API design and contract templates
- **architecture-specs/** - Architecture decision records and system design templates

### Documentation
Best practices, guides, and research notes.

- **best-practices/** - Collected wisdom on building effective AI systems

## Key Concepts

### Skills
Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that Claude automatically applies when relevant. They work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and the API, enabling consistent behavior and reusable expertise.

### Spec-Driven Development
An approach where detailed specifications guide AI-assisted development, ensuring clarity, consistency, and alignment with requirements.

### Agent Patterns
Structured approaches to building AI systems, from simple prompt chains to complex autonomous agents with tool access and dynamic decision-making.
